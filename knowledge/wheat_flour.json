    "ingredient": "Wheat Flour (Refined)",
    "role": "Base carbohydrate / Structure builder",
    "summary": "Refined wheat flour (maida) is produced by removing the bran and germ, leaving a fine starch-rich endosperm that provides structure and volume to baked and fried products. This processing strips most fibre, vitamins, and minerals, leading to high-glycaemic 'empty' calories that can spike blood sugar. High intake of refined flour products is associated with increased risk of obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and related metabolic disorders when displacing whole grains. Occasional consumption in an otherwise balanced diet is less concerning, but many public health guidelines favour whole grains over refined flours.",
    "evidence": "Strong for harm at high intakes replacing whole grains",
    "safe_limit": "No numeric limit; advised to limit refined grains and prefer whole grains for most carbohydrate intake",
