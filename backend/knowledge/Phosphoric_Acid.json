    "summary": "Phosphoric acid provides the sharp tanginess in colas and dark soft drinks while inhibiting microbial growth. It balances sweetness and contributes to the characteristic cola bite. Excessive long-term consumption from soft drinks is linked to lowered bone mineral density and potential kidney strain due to phosphorus overload. FSSAI and FDA regulate maximum levels in beverages.",
    "evidence": "Mixed; safe at regulated levels, harm at high soft drink intake",
    "safe_limit": "Regulated maximums in beverages (e.g., FSSAI cola standards); moderate total intake",
